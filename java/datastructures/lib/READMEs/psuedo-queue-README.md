- Internally, utilize 2 Stack instances to create and manage the queue
  Methods:
- enqueue
  - Arguments: value
  - Inserts a value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
- dequeue
  - Arguments: none
  - Extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
